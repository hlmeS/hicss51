## HICSS-51

### How can we apply new technologies to academic conferences?

+++

### Motivation

- _"Better understand how and why people attend sessions..." <br> Conference Chair_ |
- _"Tired of running around and manually counting attendees... " <br> Conference Organizer_|
- _"What do I get out of coming to the conference? " <br> Attendee_ |

+++

### BI Questions

- Are there patterns in the way people attend workshops? |
- Are there cliques at academic conferences?  |
- Can we provide an improved attendee experience? |
- Can we help organizers plan for upcoming conferences? |

+++

### Approach

- **RFID Tracking System**  |
- **Real-Time interface with visual analytics** |
- **Visual analytics tools for organizers (Tableau)** |
- **Machine Learning &rarr; community detection & pattern recognition (Python, R, Rapidminer)** |
